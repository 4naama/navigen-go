1.5 NaviGen File Ecosystem

frontend:

/scripts/modal-injector.js

/scripts/app.js

/styles/navi-style.css

/dash/dash.js

backend:

/backend/worker/src/index.ts

2. QR SYSTEM
2.1 Info QR

Purpose: General discovery, sharing, physical stickers, posters.

Format:

https://navigen.io/<context>?lp=<locationID>


Logged as:
/hit/qr-scan/<locationID> → signal="scan"

Signals:

scan

2.2 Promotion QR (Campaign Redemption)

Generated via:
GET /api/promo-qr?locationID=<slug>

Returns:

{
  "qrUrl": "https://navigen.io/out/qr-redeem/<slug>?camp=<key>&rt=<token>",
  "campaignName": "...",
  "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "eligibilityType": "...",
  "discountKind": "...",
  "discountValue": <number>
}


Used inside Promotion Modal → “Redeem Coupon” QR modal.

Logged as:
/hit/qr-redeem/<ULID> + token
→ signal="redeem" or signal="invalid"

Signals:

scan

redeem

invalid

Security:

Redeem tokens stored as redeem:<token> in KV

consumeRedeemToken() ensures one-time use

Campaign validity checked via date range

2.3 QR-log Schema

Stored in KV as:

qrlog:<ULID>:<YYYY-MM-DD>:<scanId>


Entry shape:

{
  "time": "ISO",
  "locationID": "<ULID>",
  "day": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "ua": "...",
  "lang": "...",
  "country": "HU",
  "city": "Budapest",
  "source": "qr-scan | qr-redeem | qr-print",
  "signal": "scan | redeem | invalid",
  "visitor": "v-xxxxxx",
  "campaignKey": "2001"
}

3. PROMOTION UX FLOWS
3.1 LPM Footer “🏷 Promotion”

When tapped:

Step 1 → Promotion Modal

Header:
Promotion

Content fields:

promotion.offer-line →
{{discount}} at {{locationName}}
Example: “10% off your purchase at World of Souvenir Deák”

promotion.period-label →
“The offer runs:”

promotion.period-range →
YYYY-MM-DD → YYYY-MM-DD

promotion.period-expires →
“Expires in {{days}}”

promotion.eligibility-label →
“Eligibility: Everyone”

promotion.code-note →
“Each code is valid for one purchase.”

promotion.show-qr →
“Show this QR code to the cashier when paying.”

campaign.redeem-terms →
“By redeeming, I agree to the offer terms.”

Button:
🔳 Redeem Coupon
(campaign.redeem-button)

Step 2 → Promotion QR Modal

Header:
Promotion QR Code
(qr.role.campaign-redeem-label)

Appearance:

same modal shell as Business Card (modal-top-bar, sticky header)

QR image only, centered, 80% width

No footer, no extra buttons

Footer text (not displayed, but used for accessibility):

qr.role.campaign-redeem-desc

qr.role.campaign-redeem-warning

3.2 Promotion QR Scan Landing

When scanning Promo QR on cashier device:

Pages Worker /out/qr-redeem/<slug>

Logs event → /hit/qr-redeem/<ULID>

Redirects user to:

https://navigen.io/?lp=<slug>


(LPM opens automatically)

Future versions may open Promotion modal automatically.

4. DASHBOARD (Dash)
4.1 Click Info

Shows CTA interactions (events from /api/track):

lpm-open

call, email, whatsapp, telegram, messenger

official, booking, newsletter

facebook…youtube

share, save, map

qr-view, qr-print

qr-scan (count from /api/track)

rating-sum

rating-average

Note: qr-redeem is not shown in Click Info.

4.2 QR Info

Shows individual scan/redeem events from qrlog.

Columns:

Time

Source (qr-scan, qr-redeem)

Location (CF)

Device (UA-bucket)

Browser

Invalid attempts

Unique visitors

Repeat %

New redeemers

Repeat redeemers

Locations (distinct countries)

Devices/Languages/Signals columns are removed from UI.

✏️ UPDATED LINE — Scan compliance column removed from UI
The “Scan compliance %” field previously visible in Campaigns is removed from the dashboard table.
It exists only as an internal value consumed by the Analytics QA Block and must not appear in merchant views.

4.4 Analytics View (Written Report Mode)
The Analytics view is a fourth dashboard mode in addition to Click Info, QR Info, and Campaigns.
It provides a narrative, human-readable business report constructed entirely on the client side from the same /api/stats payload.

Components of the Analytics Report

Header Block

Displays the selected date range

Shows location or entity name

Uses translation engine (t(key))

Prefixed with NaviGen Business Report header and timestamp

Click Analytics Summary

Aggregated description of core interaction categories

No ratios or compliance metrics

QR Analytics Summary

Narrative summary derived from QR Info data

Highlights meaningful patterns such as increases in scans or redeems

Does not include compliance or operational diagnostics

Campaigns Summary (Merchant-Safe)
(Replaces the older behavior with compliance in the merchant-facing narrative.)

✏️ UPDATED LINE — Removed mention of scan-compliance from merchant narrative

Only neutral counts are presented:

Promo QR shown (armed)

Redemptions

Invalid attempts

No ratios (e.g., compliance %, invalid %)

No anomaly language

Per-campaign mini-table and stacked bars remain as descriptive (redeemed/armed)

4.5 Quality Assurance Analysis (QA Block)
A dedicated diagnostic block only in Analytics mode, positioned after the Campaigns Summary.
This block is not shown in Click Info, QR Info, or Campaigns views.

Purpose

The QA block interprets operational quality, not merchant performance.
It evaluates internal process discipline using ratios that must not appear in merchant-facing sections.

Inputs

Computed globally across the chosen date window:

totalArmed (promo QR shown events)

totalRedeems

totalInvalid

totalAttempts = totalRedeems + totalInvalid

compliance = totalRedeems / totalArmed (when totalArmed > 0)

invalidRatio = totalInvalid / totalAttempts

Diagnostics & Required Behaviors

Neutral QA Message

When compliance ≥ ~70%

And invalidRatio not elevated

Example:
“QA: Promo scanning appears within a normal range.”

Low Scan Discipline Warning (⚠)
Trigger conditions:

compliance < 0.7

Armed > 0
Content:

Operational guidance

No merchant-blaming

Includes approximate % value

Invalid Attempt Warning (⚠)
Trigger conditions:

invalidRatio > 0.1

AND totalInvalid ≥ 3
Meaning:

Indicates expired/used/out-of-window QR usage patterns

>100% Compliance Interpretation (⚠)
Trigger conditions:

compliance > 1.05
Meaning:

Time-window misalignment (QR armed earlier than current reporting window)

Never interpreted as “excellent performance”

No Activity Case
If no promo activity recorded:
“QA: No promotion QR activity recorded; scan discipline cannot be evaluated.”

Placement

Always the last analytical block before the footer

Never shown in tables or TSV exports

Included when copying the Analytics report via ⧉

4.6 Export Behavior (⧉ Copy Button)
The dashboard includes a unified copy/export button used across all views.

Required Behaviors

Click Info / QR Info / Campaigns

⧉ copies the visible table as TSV

Column order matches the rendered DOM

Analytics View

⧉ copies the full written Analytics report as plain text

Includes:

Header

Click Summary

QR Summary

Campaigns Summary

Quality Assurance Analysis

Footer

Does not copy hidden DOM elements or styling

Parity Requirement
All four views (Click Info, QR Info, Campaigns, Analytics) must be equally exportable.

13. SEARCH CAPABILITIES (UPDATED)
13.1 Current Search – Location-First Navigation

The main shell includes a universal search bar:

🔍 “Type Destination…”

The search engine supports:

Location name search (stages, venues, facilities, shops, services)

Tag/keyword search (e.g., “toilet”, “first aid”, “vegan”, “merch”)

Context-aware ranking: top results prioritize the user’s current area and frequently accessed locations

Instant LPM open upon selection

Search is optimized for:

Fast fuzzy matching

Multi-language input

Festival-scale result sets (hundreds of dynamic places)

13.2 AI-Augmented Search (in progress)
A) Main-Shell AI Assistant (🤖 bottom band)

The AI assistant will enhance search with contextual reasoning:

Understands broad festival questions:
“Hol találok most jó ételt?”, “Mi van hozzám legközelebb?”, “Hol a következő koncert?”

Provides information about the current festival context (e.g., today’s program, important updates)

Allows dynamic context switching (e.g., food-only, music-only, emergency-only modes)

Combines search + natural language + navigation into a single interface

The assistant acts as a 0–24 walkie-talkie, answering instantly without menus.

B) LPM-Level AI Search & Knowledge

Each Location Profile Modal (LPM) receives its own AI layer:

AI can answer:

Questions about that specific location

“Mi lesz itt a következő program?”, “Mikor kezdődik a következő fellépő?”

Describe the history / role / type of that stage or service

Explain ongoing promotions, how to redeem, expiry, availability

Suggest nearby related locations based on tags (food, drink, emergency, transport, attractions)

The assistant speaks the user’s chosen language automatically.

13.3 MSM – Search-Related User Tools

The “My Stuff” area (MSM) supports several features linked to search relevance:

🌐 Language Settings

Full multilingual UI

Search results are ranked and displayed according to the user’s chosen language

💳 Purchase History

Future integration: searchable/filterable record of purchases, tickets, services

📄 Data & Privacy Center

Manages search data retention preferences

Clear display of what data impacts personalized search

📍 My Location History

Search-adaptive: frequently visited or scanned locations surface higher

Helps AI ranking

🧩 Community Zone

Topics the user cares about influence search prioritization
(music genres, food preferences, accessibility needs, etc.)

13.4 Bottom-Band Tools That Extend Search

The bottom band and overflow menu contribute additional search domains:

☎️ Emergency Call / Help Modal

Always-available quick action

Anchors search in safety-related contexts

AI uses it to prioritize emergency responses when needed

📅 Context-Specific Agenda / Timetable

Allows looking up daily schedules

Search understands queries like:
“Mikor kezdődik a következő élményprogram?”
“Hol játszik ma ez az előadó?”

ℹ️ My Contact Card (QR-Based)

Allows quick self-identification or sharing

AI can refer to the user’s general profile (never personal data) to personalize search suggestions

📣 List of Alerts

Search results deprioritize closed / unavailable locations

AI can explain active alerts (e.g., weather, crowded area alerts)

📈 My Stats

Not a search function itself, but informs ranking

Frequently interacted locations are boosted in the result list

END OF SPEC
***

✔️ Legality

You can use the IP for:

Transient analysis

City-level geolocation

Security

You must:

Not store the raw IP permanently

Not use it for fingerprinting

Use aggregate/city-level data if retaining

A compliant approach is:

Immediately geolocate the IP

Store only: {city, country, region, lat, lon (rounded)}

Discard the IP itself

This avoids GDPR issues and is standard practice.

✅ 3. Cloudflare provides FREE device geolocation

Cloudflare automatically performs an internal MaxMind lookup and injects metadata into Workers:

request.cf.city
request.cf.country
request.cf.regionCode
request.cf.latitude
request.cf.longitude


These values are derived from the real client IP, not the Cloudflare POP.

Example:
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const info = request.cf;
    const data = {
      city: info.city,
      country: info.country,
      region: info.region,
      lat: info.latitude,
      lon: info.longitude,
    };
    // Store the city-level data only
    // ...
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));
  }
}

✔️ This is the best and safest solution

No storing IPs

No running your own geolocation

No extra cost

City-level accuracy is typically correct

✔ NEVER store raw IPs

Store only:

{ "city": "...", "country": "...", "lat": xx.x, "lon": yy.y } //* No lat lon either
