    <div class="modal-body">...</div>
  </div>

13. SEARCH CAPABILITIES (UPDATED)
13.1 Current Search – Location-First Navigation

The main shell includes a universal search bar:

🔍 “Type Destination…”

The search engine supports:

Location name search (stages, venues, facilities, shops, services)

Tag/keyword search (e.g., “toilet”, “first aid”, “vegan”, “merch”)

Context-aware ranking: top results prioritize the user’s current area and frequently accessed locations

Instant LPM open upon selection

Search is optimized for:

Fast fuzzy matching

Multi-language input

Festival-scale result sets (hundreds of dynamic places)

13.2 AI-Augmented Search (in progress)
A) Main-Shell AI Assistant (🤖 bottom band)

The AI assistant will enhance search with contextual reasoning:

Understands broad festival questions:
“Hol találok most jó ételt?”, “Mi van hozzám legközelebb?”, “Hol a következő koncert?”

Provides information about the current festival context (e.g., today’s program, important updates)

Allows dynamic context switching (e.g., food-only, music-only, emergency-only modes)

Combines search + natural language + navigation into a single interface

The assistant acts as a 0–24 walkie-talkie, answering instantly without menus.

B) LPM-Level AI Search & Knowledge

Each Location Profile Modal (LPM) receives its own AI layer:

AI can answer:

Questions about that specific location

“Mi lesz itt a következő program?”, “Mikor kezdődik a következő fellépő?”

Describe the history / role / type of that stage or service

Explain ongoing promotions, how to redeem, expiry, availability

Suggest nearby related locations based on tags (food, drink, emergency, transport, attractions)

The assistant speaks the user’s chosen language automatically.

13.3 MSM – Search-Related User Tools

The “My Stuff” area (MSM) supports several features linked to search relevance:

🌐 Language Settings

Full multilingual UI

Search results are ranked and displayed according to the user’s chosen language

💳 Purchase History

Future integration: searchable/filterable record of purchases, tickets, services

📄 Data & Privacy Center

Manages search data retention preferences

Clear display of what data impacts personalized search

📍 My Location History

Search-adaptive: frequently visited or scanned locations surface higher

Helps AI ranking

🧩 Community Zone

Topics the user cares about influence search prioritization
(music genres, food preferences, accessibility needs, etc.)

13.4 Bottom-Band Tools That Extend Search

The bottom band and overflow menu contribute additional search domains:

☎️ Emergency Call / Help Modal

Always-available quick action

Anchors search in safety-related contexts

AI uses it to prioritize emergency responses when needed

📅 Context-Specific Agenda / Timetable

Allows looking up daily schedules

Search understands queries like:
“Mikor kezdődik a következő élményprogram?”
“Hol játszik ma ez az előadó?”

ℹ️ My Contact Card (QR-Based)

Allows quick self-identification or sharing

AI can refer to the user’s general profile (never personal data) to personalize search suggestions

📣 List of Alerts

Search results deprioritize closed / unavailable locations

AI can explain active alerts (e.g., weather, crowded area alerts)

📈 My Stats

Not a search function itself, but informs ranking

Frequently interacted locations are boosted in the result list
