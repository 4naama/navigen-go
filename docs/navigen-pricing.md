# NaviGen Pricing

## Simple pricing. Real results.

**NaviGen is an ad platform where your money is spent at 100% effectiveness.  
You pay for real customer visits, and while your campaign is active, you are the only operator of your listing.**

We don’t sell subscriptions, accounts, or access fees.  
You only pay when NaviGen actively promotes your business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Campaign

### €50 · 30 days

Run a 30-day campaign that actively brings customers to your business.

**What you get**
- High visibility inside NaviGen
- Real customer visits
- Full analytics dashboard
- Exclusive operation of your listing (no one else can run a campaign)

**How it feels**
> “I’m running ads, and I can see exactly what’s happening.”

This is the main way businesses use NaviGen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## After your campaign ends

### Courtesy visibility — free

When your campaign ends, we don’t drop your business immediately.

**For 60 days**
- Your business stays visible inside NaviGen
- Visibility is reduced naturally
- Promotion and analytics are paused

**How it feels**
> “People can still find me while I decide what’s next.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Optional: Keep visible

### €5 · 30 days (optional)

If you’re not ready to run another campaign yet, you can keep your place visible a bit longer.

**What this does**
- Keeps your business discoverable
- Prevents further fade-out
- Does not include promotion or analytics

This is not protection or access — just time to decide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Paused listings

If you don’t run a campaign and don’t extend visibility, your business becomes inactive on NaviGen.

**What that means**
- It won’t appear in search or lists
- It’s not promoted
- You can restart a campaign anytime

Your listing is never deleted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Restore access

Free.

If you already ran a campaign but lost access to your dashboard, you can restore it using your Stripe receipt or owner access link.

This is a recovery feature, not a paid product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example dashboards

Free.

You can view real dashboards from selected example businesses to see how NaviGen works before running a campaign.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## What we don’t sell
- Subscriptions
- Accounts
- Permanent ownership
- Fear-based protection
- Access fees

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## One sentence summary

**NaviGen lets businesses pay for time-limited attention and exclusive operation — nothing more, nothing less.**
